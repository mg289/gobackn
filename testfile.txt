Russian demonstrators clashed with riot police Monday, leading to the arrests of hundreds following a rally protesting president-elect Vladimir Putin's victory as fraudulent.

Several opposition leaders were arrested and journalists reportedly beaten during scuffles with police in riot gear, GRN's Jessica Gollogher told CBC News from Moscow.

What began as a peaceful demonstration that drew about 20,000 angry citizens to downtown Moscow reportedly turned violent for several hundred.

"[Protesters] were roughed up," said Gollogher, who attended a mass rally on Pushkin Square, about a kilometre away from the Kremlin. "I talked to many colleagues, who say they saw many protesters being dragged away in police vans." Gollogher said the tide turned when police moved in to force the dispersal of the crowds when the rally was expected to wind down. Organizers had urged protesters to continue occupying the square until Putin agreed to cede power.

"Police didn't think that people were moving quick enough, and some people were arrested after the rally was over," Gollogher said.

The atmosphere was tense to begin with, as dozens of trucks waited in several areas downtown. Scores of helmeted police wielding riot shields stood guard.

Outspoken blogger and opposition leader Alexey Navalny, who has emerged as a leading anti-government voice, was among those arrested, CBC's Alex Shprintsen reported from Moscow.
